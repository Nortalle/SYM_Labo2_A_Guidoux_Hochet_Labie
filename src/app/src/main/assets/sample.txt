Gregory Butterscotch looked at the ripped teapot in his hands and felt stable.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his industrial surroundings. He had always hated grand Moscow with its worried, wet waters. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stable.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Daniel Bishop. Daniel was a peculiar carer with red elbows and pretty arms.

Gregory gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a spiteful, incredible, cocoa drinker with brown elbows and chubby arms. His friends saw him as a frightened, fragile friend. Once, he had even helped a healthy owl recover from a flying accident.

But not even a spiteful person who had once helped a healthy owl recover from a flying accident, was prepared for what Daniel had in store today.

The moon shone like bopping ostriches, making Gregory happy.

As Gregory stepped outside and Daniel came closer, he could see the dirty glint in his eye.

"I am here because I want justice," Daniel bellowed, in a greedy tone. He slammed his fist against Gregory's chest, with the force of 1969 frogs. "I frigging hate you, Gregory Butterscotch."

Gregory looked back, even more happy and still fingering the ripped teapot. "Daniel, I am your mother," he replied.

They looked at each other with stressed feelings, like two deadly, dripping donkeys sitting at a very noble funeral, which had piano music playing in the background and two delightful uncles jogging to the beat.

Suddenly, Daniel lunged forward and tried to punch Gregory in the face. Quickly, Gregory grabbed the ripped teapot and brought it down on Daniel's skull.

Daniel's red elbows trembled and his pretty arms wobbled. He looked unstable, his body raw like a smoggy, shaky sausage.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Daniel Bishop was dead.

Gregory Butterscotch went back inside and made himself a nice mug of cocoa.
